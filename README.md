# IPA-Translator

> Takes English sentences and translates them to IPA, the standard alphabet for international linguistical studies. 

**NOTE:** this repository contains the codebase for the translator's front and backend logic. Each part of the project will be hosted separately. The user interacts with a UI (website) that sends requests to the hosted backend. 

## THIS PROJECT IS A WORK - IN - PROGRESS!!

## ABOUT

This is a passion project developed for linguistic study or just for people to have fun with. I took a linguistics course at university that I thoroughly enjoyed and thought it would be quite useful to have a readily available IPA translator online.

I noticed that there aren't many websites with aesthetically pleasing and effective IPA translators. My goal was to create such a website so that people studying linguistics can easily find the IPA translations for words without having to construct it themselves or search through literature. 

**NOTE:** this translator uses the English-to-ARPABET dictionary created and maintained by [Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)](https://www.cmu.edu/). Their translator and dictionary can be found [here.](http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict)

I did not make an English-to-ARPABET translator because IPA is an internationally recognized phonetic standard. Likewise, ARPABET is intended for use in ASCII-based systems, not necessarily linguistic study.
